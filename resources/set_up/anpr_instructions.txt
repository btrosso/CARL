1. Load an image of a vehicle with a visible license plate.
2. Preprocess the image to enhance the license plate region (e.g., convert to grayscale, apply filters
    for noise reduction).
3. Detect and localize the license plate within the image (e.g., use edge detection algorithms like Canny
    edge detection).
4. Extract the license plate region from the image.
5. Perform further processing on the extracted license plate region (e.g., binarization, morphological operations
    for segmentation).
6. Apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to the segmented license plate region to recognize the characters.
7. Post-process the OCR results (e.g., filter out non-alphanumeric characters, correct any recognition errors).
8. Annotate the original image with the recognized license plate number or characters (e.g., draw a bounding box
    around the license plate region and overlay the recognized text).
9. Save the annotated image to a specified folder location on the filesystem.
