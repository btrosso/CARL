Here is a typical workflow for pushing code and tagging a release:

1. Complete Development: Finish writing and testing your code changes locally.
2. Commit Changes: Use git add . to stage all changes and git commit -m "Message" to commit them with a
    descriptive message.
3. Tag the Release: Create a tag using git tag v1.0 (replace v1.0 with your desired tag name).
4. Push Changes: Push your changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name (replace branch-name
    with your branch name, e.g., main or master).
5. Push Tags: After pushing the code changes, push the tags to the remote repository using git push --tags.
